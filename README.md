Pollen allergies pose significant health challenges, particularly as climate change and urbanization alter environmental conditions. This study aims to identify and analyze the key environmental factors influencing pollen levels, focusing on temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and air quality indicators (ozone, PM10, and NO2). Using a neural network model, we evaluated the relative importance of these features in predicting pollen concentrations, revealing distinct correlations. The results indicate that temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation have a negative correlation with pollen levels, suggesting that higher temperatures and humidity can enhance pollen release, while precipitation can lead to variable effects. In contrast, ozone, PM10, and NO2 demonstrate a positive correlation with pollen levels, particularly ozone, which exhibited the strongest influence. The findings underscore the complexity of environmental interactions affecting allergenic responses and highlight the need for effective monitoring systems. This study provides insights for public health initiatives, resource allocation, and environmental management strategies aimed at mitigating pollen-related health risks, especially for sensitive populations. Implementing data-driven alert systems and public awareness campaigns based on these findings can enhance climate resilience and improve health outcomes for allergy sufferers.
